Hello my name is Hakan Karadeniz.

This board was designed by me in my internship in Portugal/Coimbra University in Computer and Electronics Engineering Department in Embedded Systems Lab.

You can read the DRV8231A data sheet for use.

You can run it with AutoDesk Eagle and Fusion360 programs.

Thank you.
